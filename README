Ski Game

Mini LD 47 "Humble Beginnings" Submission

This is a reconstruction of the first game I created based on my faint memory.
It was 1983 and I was using Toshiba PASOPIA.

I knew very little about English and the most messages were written in
Japanese katakana, which was common among 8-bit PCs then.

I think the actual game was much shabbier. I don't know why I used yellow as
the backgroud color, but after finishing this, I remember I was very proud of myself.

The font used in this version was taken from NEC PC-8001,
but I don't believe there is much difference.
