<h1>Ski Game</h1>
<p>
This is a reconstruction of the first game I created based on my faint memory.<br>
It was 1983 and I was using Toshiba PASOPIA.
<p>
I knew very little about English and the most messages were written in<br>
Japanese katakana, which was common among 8-bit PCs then.
<p>
I think the actual game was much shabbier. I don't know why I used yellow as<br>
the backgroud color, but after finishing this, I remember I was very proud of myself.
<p>
The font used in this version was taken from NEC PC-8001, <br>
but I don't believe there is much difference.
